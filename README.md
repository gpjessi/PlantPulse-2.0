# PlantPulse-2.0
PlantPulse is a smart plant-monitoring system designed to help home growers and plant parents understand their plant’s needs in real time. Using an ESP32 microcontroller and three sensors (soil moisture, light, and temperature/humidity), the system collects environmental data and sends it to a custom web dashboard. The goal is to make plant care simple, clear, and based on real information so people can understand what their plants need.

 System Overview
PlantPulse collects environmental data from three sensors, sends it to an ESP32, and displays it on a lightweight web dashboard. Users interpret the data and take positive care actions.
